Dashboards
==========

The additionals plugin version 3.0.0 comes with new dashboard support (Drag & Drop).

The dashboard configuration takes place directly in Redmine:

*  Home
*  Project overview
*  If other plugins, that support the dashboard functionality are installed (e.g. HRM Plugin) also:

    * HRM overview page

Dashboard: Home
---------------
 
When accessing Redmine you probably get redirected to the "Home" page of the system. There you can modify or add new dashboards by using the respective action links in the head section of the content area.
